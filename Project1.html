            <h4>Biography</h4>

            <p>The name Acme comes from the Greek (ἀκμή, English transliteration: akmē), meaning summit, highest point, extremity or peak.[1] It has been falsely claimed to be an acronym, either for "A Company Making Everything", "American Companies Make Everything", or "American Company that Manufactures Everything."[2][3] During the 1920s, the word was commonly used in the names of businesses in order to be listed toward the beginning of alphabetized telephone directories like the Yellow Pages, and implied being the best. It is used in an ironic sense in cartoons, because the products are often failure-prone or explosive.[4]</p>

                <li>The company is never clearly defined in Road Runner cartoons but appears to be a conglomerate which produces every product type imaginable</li>
